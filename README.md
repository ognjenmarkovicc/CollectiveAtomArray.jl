# CollectiveAtomArray

**CollectiveAtomArray.jl** is a Julia package for simulating the behavior of collective excitations in 
an atomic array.
## Development status

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ognjenmarkovicc/CollectiveAtomArray.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ognjenmarkovicc/CollectiveAtomArray.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

## Installation

1. Add the package to your julia environment 
    ```|pkg> add https://github.com/ognjenmarkovicc/CollectiveAtomArray.jl.git```
2. Test the package by running an example script

## Documentation

The purpose of this package is to provide an easy interface for experimentalists to quickly calculate expected observables of excited atomic arrays.

Several example scripts replicating some published results in the field are given in the /scripts folder.
